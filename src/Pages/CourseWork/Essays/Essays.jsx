            <Essay question="Q1: Explain the difference between HTML, CSS and JavaScript.">
                <p>
                    <b>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</b> is the
                    content/information of a website. It defines the headers,
                    paragraphs, images, and links that go on a website. HTML
                    takes care of what will be presented to a user on a site. It
                    has some capabilities of adjusting the color, text
                    alignment, and font size, however, those functions mainly
                    fall under CSS. Keywords: tags, hierarchy (h1, h2).

                <p>
                    <b>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</b> is in charge of styling
                    and controls the design of a website. Without CSS a website
                    will lack visual appeal. JavaScript is the last piece of the
                    puzzle and while not necessary for creating a website, it
                    can greatly enhance it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>JavaScript</b> adds interactivity to a website which can
                    be found in hover states of buttons, pop-ups, autofill,
                    carousels, and really any moving parts of a website. This
                    can help with making a website feel more responsive.

                    <li>Version control software (VCS)</li>
                    <li>
                        Used as a command line tool and ran locally (on your
                        computer)

                        Allows you to work on different versions/branches of a
                        code base

                    <li>
                        Helps to synchronize (merge) different versions of the

                <b>Summary</b>
                <p>
                    Git tracks the changes made to your code and allows you to
                    revert back to earlier versions of your code. You can also
                    create a branch from your main line of code which allows you
                    to make changes to the code on that branch without affecting
                    the master branch.{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                    You need to push and pull code to and from GitHub to keep
                    your local and remote repositories in sync and up to date.

                    stakeholders. They have the authority to make key decisions
                    and in particular, are responsible for making sure the team
                    is working on the right items. It is helpful for the product

                    A product manager is the person who identifies the customer

                    non-technical information. Once they fully understand the
                    challenges, they outline the requirements for a solution and
